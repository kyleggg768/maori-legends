        <h2>The Story of Māui and the Fish</h2>
        <p>
            According to Māori legend, Māui, a demigod known for his cleverness and bravery, went fishing with his brothers using a magical hook. 
            Māui's hook caught a giant fish, which he pulled from the sea. 
            This fish became the North Island of New Zealand. The story highlights Māui’s ingenuity and his significant role in shaping the land.

        <h2>The Creation of Aotearoa</h2>
        <p>
            The Māori creation story describes how the world was formed by the gods. Aotearoa (New Zealand) was created when the gods separated the land from the sea, 
            shaping the mountains, rivers, and valleys. 
            This legend explains the spiritual connection between the Māori people and their land, illustrating the divine origins of their homeland.

            fell in love with Tūtānekai, a chief from a different tribe.
